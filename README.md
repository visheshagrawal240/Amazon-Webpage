This project is a simple, static webpage designed to showcase "Minimalist" brand skincare products. It mimics a basic e-commerce layout, featuring a navigation header, a grid of products, and a footer, styled to resemble the Amazon website.
The webpage is built with HTML and CSS. It displays four different skincare products, each with an image and a short description. The page includes links to the Amazon website for purchasing the products. The styling is done in a separate CSS file (style.css), which defines the colors, layout, and positioning of elements.

Features
  Navigation Bar: A header at the top of the page includes a link to the Amazon homepage, Account, My Cart, and Contact Us links, along with a search bar.
  Product Grid: Four products are displayed in a 2x2 grid format.
  Product Cards: Each product has its own "card" with a title, image, and description.
  External Links: Links direct the user to Amazon's website to view the product or more purchasing options.
  Fixed Footer: A footer with copyright information remains fixed at the bottom of the page.

Technologies Used
HTML5: Used for the structure and content of the webpage.
CSS3: Used for styling, including layout, colors, and positioning.
